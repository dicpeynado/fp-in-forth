# FP Language in Forth
## Function Programming Language by John Backus implemented in Forth.

After reading the famous Turing Award lecture by John Backus ['Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and Its Algebra of Programs'](http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~beck/csc8310/BackusFP.pdf), I wanted to test his ideas, but never found an interpreter that I liked. My attempts to write the interpreter in other languages were unsuccessful, but using Forth, I was able to extend the language enough to explore the concepts of functional programming as Backus envisioned.

The source code fp.forth has been tested in [ForthWin](https://github.com/PeterForth/ForthWin-Download).
